ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rishabh Jain!

I am a business analyst with a background in management, currently pursuing my M.S. in Business Analytics at Northeastern University. With over three years of experience in high-growth startups, I specialize in applying data-driven strategies to enhance decision-making, optimize operations, and drive business performance.

My professional focus lies at the intersection of analytics and strategyâ€”translating complex datasets into actionable insights. I am proficient in tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, and have hands-on experience in churn prediction, customer segmentation, optimization modeling, and KPI dashboard development.

This GitHub portfolio is a curated collection of projects that demonstrate my analytical capabilities and strategic thinking. I am eager to continue building meaningful solutions, collaborating with diverse teams, and contributing to data-led innovation.
